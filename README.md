# Java Migration Copilot Samples

## Samples:

- [mi-sql-public-demo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-migration-copilot-samples/tree/main/mi-sql-public-demo) : Getting started sample that migrates an app to use Managed Identities instead of password.

- [rabbitmq-sender](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-migration-copilot-samples/tree/main/rabbitmq-sender) : Getting started sample application that sends messages to a RabbitMQ message broker. Demonstrate creating and applying your own custom migration formulas.

- [asset manager](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-migration-copilot-samples/tree/main/asset-manager) : This is a complete workshop with an end-to-end scenario that migrates an app to Azure using predefined and custom formulas. After the migration, the app will run on Azure Container Apps and interact with Auzure Blob, Azure Service Bus and Azure Database for PostgreSQL.

- [Todo Web API with Oracle Database](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-migration-copilot-samples/tree/main/todo-web-api-use-oracle-db) A To-do application using Oracle database for storage. It leverages Oracle-specific SQL features and data types, for instance, VARCHAR2. This sample migrates the application to use Azure Database for PostgreSQL instead.

- [Student Web App - Jakarta EE](jakarta-ee/student-web-app) A Java EE web application running on Open Liberty with a hybrid architecture that supports both traditional servlets and Spring MVC. The application manages student profiles with CRUD operations and demonstrates migrating from Ant to Maven and Java EE to Jakarta EE.

## Building All Projects

To quickly verify that all Maven projects build successfully, you can use the provided build script:

```bash
./build-all.sh
```

This script will:
- Check your Java version
- Build all Maven-based sample projects
- Provide a summary of successful and failed builds

**Requirements**: Java 17 or later

## Branches

* `main`: source projects
* `expected`: expected changes after migration
